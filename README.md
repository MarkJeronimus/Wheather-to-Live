# Weather to Live

<sub>A pun on both "Where to live (for nice weather)" and "Whether to live" (hehe.)</sub>

**It's a nifty search engine to find coordinates on the globe with your preferred weather.**

Since it depends on huge amounts​ of external data (potentially in the terabytes)​, it necessarily had to be made as an offline tool.


### Usage
The bottom panel shows individual weather parameters, each with a min and max.  
Changing the min and max changes the range of that climate element that you consider pleasant.  
The filters are combined to find the coordinates that match <i>all</i> of the filters.  
Coordinates that were filtered out are blacked out in the main viewer.  
Each month is filtered individually, unless the 'Filter entire year' checkbox is checked.

The main viewer can be zoomed and dragged like a Maps app. The colors are from the last touched parameter.
